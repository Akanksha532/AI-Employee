# AI-Employee
Pipelined the task to be performed by an AI employee for data cleaning and processing
1. Data Processing
   This module reads the data from the specified file format and loads it into a Pandas DataFrame.
   The function automatically detects the file format based on its extension and applies the appropriate loading method.
   CSV Handling: Uses pd.read_csv() to load data from comma-separated values files.
   JSON Handling: Uses pd.read_json() to load data from JSON files.
   Excel Handling: Uses pd.read_excel() to load data from Excel files (.xlsx).
   
3. Create a Data Cleaning and Preprocessing Pipeline
   Data Cleaning: Handles missing values, duplicates, and outliers. Missing values can be imputed with statistical measures like mean or median, or removed if necessary.
   Feature Engineering: This could involve scaling, normalization, binning, or encoding categorical variables.
   
4. Develop an Analysis Engine

  The analysis engine is designed to identify key trends and patterns within the processed data.
  To enhance the analysis capabilities, three different statistical or machine learning algorithms are implemented:
  
  i) Decision Trees (Supervised Learning):
  
  A tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences, including chance event outcomes, resource costs, and utility.
  Effective for classification tasks where the goal is to categorize data into predefined classes based on input features.
  
  ii) K-Means Clustering (Unsupervised Learning):
  
  A clustering algorithm that partitions the dataset into k distinct clusters based on feature similarity.
  Useful for identifying natural groupings within the data, such as customer segmentation or grouping countries based on performance.
  
  iii) Linear Regression (Supervised Learning):  
  
  A linear approach to modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
  Applied to predict continuous outcomes and understand the influence of multiple factors on a target variable.

4. Create a Report Generation Module
  The report generation module is responsible for compiling the analysis results into a comprehensive report.
  This module not only presents the raw results but also includes visualizations
  Visualizations: Generates charts and graphs such as bar charts, scatter plots.
  These visual aids help in quickly grasping trends and patterns in the data.
